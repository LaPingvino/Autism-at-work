What is this?
=============

This is a setup I made myself to be able to quickly create a book with Markdown, to worry about layout etc later.

How to use it?
--------------

Simply edit the `start` and `stop` files to change the resulting book page, and `startc` and `stopc` to edit the html surrounding the chapters.
Create a list of files in order of the chapters in an index file (example available in `exampleindex`) and create the html with `./publish exampleindex`.
