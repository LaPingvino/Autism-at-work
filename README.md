About the project
=================

This is a personal project to write a book about autism. Although it's written by me and using my perspectives and experiences, it is here on github for a reason: I am really interested in the perspectives and experiences of other people around here, be it employers, employees, programmers, parents, brothers and sisters or whatever person related to autism.

I would be interested as well in people who can tell me more about Silicon Valley and autism there, how social stuff works out there etc. I think it can be a great illustration of the important point that autism is about working differently, not worse. Please fork and contribute to your liking.

The content of this book will be CC-BY-3.0. If you are making contributions and you want me to be able to merge them in, please be clear about the licensing, and please don't bring me into trouble by licensing too restrictive (i.e. CC-0 is fine, CC-BY-NC I prefer not to handle; non-commercial is a fuzzy scary restriction for me).

That's it for now, have fun reading the horribly incomplete book for now :).
