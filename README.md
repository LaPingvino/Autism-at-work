About the project
=================

This is a personal project to write a book about autism. Although it's written by me and using my perspectives and experiences, it is here on github for a reason: I am really interested in the perspectives and experiences of other people around here, be it employers, employees, programmers, parents, brothers and sisters or whatever person related to autism.

I would be interested as well in people who can tell me more about Silicon Valley and autism there, how social stuff works out there etc. I think it can be a great illustration of the important point that autism is about working differently, not worse. Please fork and contribute to your liking.

The content of this book will be CC-BY-3.0. If you are making contributions and you want me to be able to merge them in, please be clear about the licensing, and please don't bring me into trouble by licensing too restrictive (i.e. CC-0 is fine, CC-BY-NC I prefer not to handle; non-commercial is a fuzzy scary restriction for me).

How does this all work?
=======================

The chapters of the book are in the chapter-directory (which is a logical place for them to be) and are in the Markdown format. Markdown is a way to write documents without bothering about the markup just yet, I think that's why they called it markDOWN instead. Anyway, in Markdown you just write your text as if you were writing an e-mail and you cannot use markup.

    Markdown uses titles like this
    ==============================
    
    And then the text of the article comes here
    and goes on without you worrying about anything.
    
    ## You can also write titles like this, the number of #'s telling how many levels deep the header is.
    
    - and lists go like this
    - going on
    - and on
    - and on
    
This keeps my mind free of markup-issues (well, mostly) until the writing has been done.
